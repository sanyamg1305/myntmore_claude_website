            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#52525B" }}>
              In B2B, buyers are suffering from trust fatigue. Every day, they are bombarded with cold emails, LinkedIn requests, and sponsored posts from companies they have never heard of. People do not buy from logos anymore. They buy from people they trust.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style={{ color: "#0a0a0a" }}>What a founder brand actually does</h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4" style={{ color: "#52525B" }}>
              A founder brand is not about being &apos;LinkedIn famous.&apos; It is about building a trust layer that makes everything else in your business work better. It makes your outbound convert at a higher rate, makes your recruiting easier, and makes your inbound predictable.
            </p>
            <div className="rounded-xl p-6" style={{ backgroundColor: "#FEF9EC", border: "1px solid rgba(245,183,49,0.3)" }}>

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#52525B" }}>
              Think about what happens when you send a cold message to a prospect. The very first thing they do is click on your profile. If they see a consistent history of insightful, helpful content, their perception of you changes. You are no longer just another salesperson. You are an expert in your field who has provided value before even asking for a meeting.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#52525B" }}>
              The secret is to document, not create. Instead of trying to think of new ideas, just look at your calendar. What questions did a client ask you today? If you really do not have time to write, use a voice note. Record a two-minute thought on your phone while walking or driving. That is enough raw material for 4 LinkedIn posts.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style={{ color: "#0a0a0a" }}>The long game</h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#52525B" }}>
              Your company might change. Your product might pivot. But your personal brand and your reputation stay with you forever. In the modern B2B landscape, being invisible is a choice, and it is a very expensive one. Your name is the highest leverage asset your company has. It is time you started using it.
