              For high-ticket B2B eCommerce, you can even use outbound. If you see a major account visiting your site repeatedly, you do not wait for them to fill out a form. You use your outbound engine to reach out to the decision makers at that company with a helpful, context-led message.

              Too many founders look for a &apos;hack&apos; or a &apos;trick&apos; to increase conversion. Real conversion is about building a system that respects the user and provides genuine value at every step. Conversion is not about tricking people into buying. It is about making it as easy as possible for the right people to say yes.
